# Penetration-Testing

During my information security block, I downloaded and installed Kali Linux. I took screenshots and gathered data to document my activities, which included scanning ports and identifying other networks. I familiarized myself with command lines and attempted penetration tests. Additionally, I engaged in friendly "handshakes" with nearby devices that I knew and had permission to interact with.
